proccess
--------
my process:

i splattered together 
concotions of glue: 
poems and models.  

muses decide word 
materials get chopped 
harshly, cut, 
affixed to all.  

instruction setting 
is the expression i 
would ascribe painting 
of images by assigning
variables to truths and
falsitity, buffering 
boolean operations.

it's about encompassesing 
programming and poetry into 
new forms of thinking.

recomposing truths, 
wording and rewording.

the truth to me is that programming is ultimatly a game of inherited reasoning running through shape reshelf compositions.

technology is just interfaces and interface sport is absurd game.  an interface is just an abstraction of a truth value set to 0 or 1, both in our minds and in machines.

all of technology is intentional.  
technology is humanity reprogramming own programming.  

gluing interfaces plugging side by side. 
technology is about embracing 
odd rough absurd orthonolognal 
obtuse machocistic edges.
